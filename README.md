# pocketCompanion
A app for managing the life and points of interest of your pet (independent of species, we have a huge catalog)

## First order of business

 - Make some mockup screens
 - Setup a pet register page
 - Setup a base DB with range to increase tables columns
 - Fetch all scaterred data to provide a inicial base
 - Scope the main functions and start to code
 
 Tech stuff:
 
 - Python (Kivy)
 - SQLite3 (for now)

Adendum:

 - This is my first project of this kind, looking foward for help, keep in mind I'm open to changes in technologies and proposal of funcionalities. 
 - More to come
